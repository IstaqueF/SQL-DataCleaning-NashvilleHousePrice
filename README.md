# SQL - Nashville house price Project

In this project I have cleaned the data and prepared it for the analysis. 
The initial spreadsheet contained multiple inconsistencies in format and in value which needed to be fixed before we could proceed for the main analysis. 

The below operations were carried out

#1 chnaged data type of the column to make it consistent 

#2 Update database with new data type 

#3 Find the NULL values in specific columns and populating them using SELF JOIN 

#4 breaking out the long string (Address) and assign the separate values in new columns 

#5 Update the database with these newly created columns

#6 Changed datatype of specific column from bit to nvarchar and assigned values of "Yes" and "No" in place of 0 and 1. 

#7 Created a temporary table and removed duplicate rows. (I created a temporary table as didn't want to remove values from the origical database) 

#8 Deleted unused columns
